# Physics_Engine
This project explores concepts at the intersection of differential geometry and physics, implemented with a focus on performance and low-level programming techniques.
## [Single Particle Simulation](https://github.com/faitinchan/Physics_Engine/blob/main/single_particle.c)
Simulating the motion of a single particle with randomized initial position and zero initial veolcity under Earth's gravitational acceleration.
