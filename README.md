# Physics_Engine
This project explores concepts at the intersection of differential geometry and physics, implemented with a focus on performance and low-level programming techniques.
## [Single Particle Simulation](https://github.com/faitinchan/Physics_Engine/tree/main/1)
This simulation models the motion of a single particle, initially at rest and randomly positioned, under the influence of Earth's gravitational field.
